# 玩法

现在您可以在进入新的Minecraft世界时从各族小马中任选其一作为您的新身份，选项包括独角兽、天马、陆马、夜骐和幻形灵。

选择不同的种族将给您带来不同的技能，这些技能这将以几个圆形图标显示在您的UHD上。
若要激活不同的技能，只需要按住其对应绑定的按键。有些技能需要您按住更长的时间来激活，另外有些技能所需按住时间较短，只需快速单击或双击即可激活。

## 不同种族的技能

### 独角兽

 - 魔法

   独角兽需要魔法宝石来施法，没有魔法的普通宝石可以从挖矿活动中取得。一开始，您需要用一颗宝石和一本书合成魔法书，魔法书将助力您解析各物品中含有的要素并辅助您用这些要素开发各类魔咒配方，同样可以用于修饰已有配方。

   当您做出了所需的魔法宝石后，您可以拿着它右键以将其中的魔法导入到主槽位或是副槽位（按下潜行键）中 ，这些魔咒将可以以您的主技能形式激活。您也可以直接拿着魔法宝石释放其中的魔力。

 - 瞬移
   
   独角兽可以通过瞬移跃迁到远处，偶尔能够越过最多两个方块厚的墙或地板。他们也可以带着朋友一并瞬移，前提是这些朋友要戴上签了他们名字的友谊手环。
   
   独角兽们可以通过按下潜行键以选择瞬移到墙的背面。为了和您一起瞬移，您的朋友们可能需要按下Page Up/Page Down来切换UHD页面。

### 陆马
 - 尥蹶子和重蹄出击

   陆马尥蹶子劲儿大.

   如果您安装了Mine Little Pony，且调整外观为小马模型，那么在使用尥蹶子技能时，您将会踢中你背后的方块，所以快转过身来吧！
   不停踢中单个方块会起到类似挖掘的效果，踢中树干则会将树枝上的物品抖落下来。 踢中同一棵树 _太多次_ 可能会把它踢坏，
   请蹄下留情！

 - 重蹄出击
   类似方向向下的尥蹶子。跃到空中激活此技能可落到上产生碾压冲击波，这将损坏方块和推开其他生灵。
   如果冲击波持续不断的话，方块也最终会被破坏。

 - 不动如山

   陆马可以通过按下潜行键绷紧肌肉！这将，呃，让你很难被推动！没错就是这样！

### 天马/夜骐

 - 抱起生灵/玩家

   天马可以将各种生灵抱起来。用于出门旅行再合适不过！激活技能就可以抱起你所注视着的生灵，
   再次激活技能即可扔下他们。

 - 鸟式飞行

   天马可以通过助跑或是跃到空中以起飞，亦可使用三级技能来伸展或收回翅膀。
   飞到空中后，您需要拍打翅膀（按住跳跃键）以推动您向前和向上移动和，亦可向下滑行(需要按下潜行键)。
   您可以按下方向键以控制方向，慢下来，以稳定在同一个位置。
   
   
### Pegasi (only)
 - Ranbooms / Dashing
   
   Using the ability whilst flying will allow pegasi to perform a sonic rainboom that deafens the ears of your enemies and shatters glass!
   It may take some practice, but the results are most satisfying.

 - Capturing Storms
   
   Give a pegasuscloud, and they'll have water for a day, give a pegasus a bottle, and they'll capture the clouds and make it rain all
   summer. I think that's how the saying goes? Anywho, you can right-click with bottles to capture rain in a bottle during storms.

   Doing this will both stop it from raining and store the weather in the bottle for later use.
   
   Dropping bottles on the ground during a thunder storm is also the only way to obtain lightning in a bottle.

### Bat Ponies
 - Screeching
 
   Eeee! Eee-Eeee! Eeee!
   
   Bat ponies can screeeeEEeeeeEEEEech!
   
   Besides annoying other players, they also deal some awesome knockback and a tiny bit of damage to anypony or anything that's caught off-guard by
   your terrifying howl. It's so scary you might just scare yourself!

 - Night Vision
   Bat Ponies have night vision. They can see in the dark, like true sisters of the night! The drawback of this is you can't look at the sun, or be
   anywhere near sunlight in general. Luckily uou can craft some really cool sunglasses to protect your precious assets!
   
   Or wear a pumpkin. That works too.
   
   (Bat Ponies also respawn in dark places)
   
 - Hanging of Ceilings

   Ever just want to hang out? Well bat ponies can, _literally_! All the cool kids are doing.

### Changelings

 - Insectoid Flight

   Flying as a changeling is somewhat simpler. It's closer to creative flight.
   
 - Draining Love

   Love is the primary source of nutrition for Changelings. They can't eat a lot else, so they have to seek out hostile mobs and certain livestock to
   sustain themselves. Alternatively, love can also be 'stolen' in-transit from the crystal heart if a changeling drops a bucket, bottle, or mug
   anywhere nearby.
   
 - Shapeshifting
   
   Changelings can turn into damn near anything, even other players! And blocks! And hostile mobs!
   Careful about turning into skeletons, though, because they hate the sun even more than bat ponies.

## Special Items, Plants, Tools

### Polearms

Polearms function like a combination of a spear and a sword. They have longer cooldown and a minor knockback, but will grant the user extra reach distance
when equipped. Perfect for farming those unusual, magical blocks from a safer distance.

Fighting too close together with them may cause you some knockback.

### Zap Apples

Zap Apple Trees occur naturally in the world and are the only way to obtain zap apples in survival. They can appear in one of several different states:

Hybernating, Flowering, Fruiting, or Withering

They cycle through these states throughout the lunar cycle, so if you find one and it's not in the state you want, wait around another few days and it
will eventually bear fruit, but don't try to harvest the apples before they're ripe, because they will zap you!

If you're able to obtain the wood and leaves, it also make the perfect deterant to griefers.

### Muffins

They're bouncy and delicious, and pigs absolutely love them!
