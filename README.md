# Unicopia Redux

A re-implementation of the original pony poers mod without Blazeloader.!

Adds abilities for each of the races included in Mine Little Pony.

Features:

 - **Clouds!**
    Pegasi have the ability to fly and interact with clouds. Busting wild clouds yields cloud matter which can be used to craft tame clouds and cloud blocks for building in the sky.
 - **Apple!**
    More types of apples, including cooked apples and Zap Apples. Earth Ponies can obtain all these types of apples by bucking/kicking trees.
 - **Magic!**
    Unicorns can teleport and cast a shield for protection. They can also craft and enchant gems to attach different effects. Two gems can be paired to create portals allowing _anypony_ to teleport from point A to point B.
 - **Changelings!**
    Changelings can't eat normal food, but they _can_ obtain sustenance from feeding off of hostile mobs and other players.
