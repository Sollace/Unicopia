Adds abilities and magic for each of the races included in Mine Little Pony.

## Features

 - **Magic!**
		Ponies with magic such as unicorns and alicorn can cast different spells - currently only the shield is available, and also teleport
 - **Apples!**
    More types of apples, including cooked apples and Zap Apples. Earth Ponies can obtain all these types of apples by bucking/kicking trees.
 - **Earth Ponies!**
		Earth Ponies are stronger and heavier than the other two tribes.
 - **Changelings!**
		Changelings have the unique ability to disguise themselves as any other entity. Sometimes even blocks too!
		Every disguise somes with its own, unique abilities to that mod.
    Changelings don't eat normal food, but they _can_ obtain sustenance from feeding off of hostile mobs and other players.
		They can also fly.
 - **Bats! EEEEEE!!**
		Bat ponies, like pegasi, can fly. They can also hang upside-down underneath ledges,
		and scare enemies with a deafening SCREEEEEEEEEECH!
 - **Flight!**
    Ponies with wings, such as pegasi have the ability to fly. Build up momentum or find a convenient cliff to take flight.
		Flap your wings (SHIFT) to gain extra altitude, or hold space hover and glide (FORWARDS)
 - **Thunderstorms~**
		Beware of thunderstorms. Flying in them can become treacherous.

## Some notes for people wondering how the mod works:

Since everything is based on the type of tribe the player selects, obviously I want there to be an easy way to switch, however it can't be anything too obtrusive of immersion breaking (like a gui), or too hard like a magic item you find on a quest.

For now, for easy of development, there is the super simple /race command that anyone can use. (try using the `/help race` command. It's really quite amazing). There are also the `/disguise` and `/gravity` commands for similar purposes, none of which I plan to remove.

If you're a server admin, you can also allow and disallow specific tribes on your server using the `/racelist` command. it works more or less the same as the `/whitelist` command. (Again, `/help` is a gem of a command)
